# Memory Match Game
This game uses the Deck of Cards API and a custom REST API to provide the user a game where they must click on two face down cards with the intent that face value of each card will be matching. User features include: account creation, login, creation of a new game, a choice for how many cards to play, and their highest score being added to a leaderboard.
